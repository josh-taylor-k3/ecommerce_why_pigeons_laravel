# Food and Maybe some Pigeons?

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

## Installation

1. Clone the repo and `cd` into it
2. `composer install`
3. Create a `pigeon` sql database and set your database credentials in the `.env` file.
4. Set your `APP_URL` in your `.env` file. This is needed for Voyager to correctly resolve asset URLs.
5. `npm install`
6. `npm run dev`
7. `php artisan storage:link`
